# Welcome to the test results of Stock Prediction

Hi! We are group 12 and we are testing a [system that predicts stock prices](https://github.com/lokesh45/StockPrediction).
This is a repository made as part of the curriculum at NC State for the course CSC 510 Software Engineering.

## Description of the source repository

The source repository `https://github.com/lokesh45/StockPrediction` is an attempt to predict the uncertain nature of the stock market.

Over here, we find a flask app, where the web application can be started. A detailed explanation of the application, model, schema, and setup instructions can be found on the [repository](https://github.com/lokesh45/StockPrediction).
